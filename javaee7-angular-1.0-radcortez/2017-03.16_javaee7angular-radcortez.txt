Javascript Package Management – NPM – Bower – Grunt
http://www.radcortez.com/javascript-package-management-npm-bower-grunt/

new features on Java EE 7: 
now you can run sql in a standard way by using the properties 
javax.persistence.schema-generation.* and it also binds you to a default datasource 
if you don’t provide one. 
So for this case, it’s going to use the internal Wildfly H2 database for our application.
